# Goal_4.0
This Repository permits to run the same exact code used in a real scenario inside a simulation based environment. 
The packe cvg_sim_gazebo provide all the launch files required to load the simulation environment.
Please remeber that the dynamics of the robot is simulated by the DJI Matrice Simulator, running inside the DJI Assistant Application. 
This simulates the DJI onboard SDK, providing all the topics needed to iteract with the lower control framework.
